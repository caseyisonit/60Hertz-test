# [Salom Mulabi Fashion Forecast](https://murmuring-falls-83094.herokuapp.com/)

## Code
I chose to build this app with `Creat-React-App` and deploy with Heroku. I used React Hooks to streamline the code through setState and useEffect. The frontend frame work is built on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) utilizing [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) with styled-components and CSS. Incorporated two components that can be scaled as features are added.

### Packages
```npm i axios moment reactstrap bootstrap styled-components```

### Coding Articles
Besides referencing old projects to remember tips and tricks I referenced several online articles
- [A Guide To Handling Internet Disconnection In React Applications](https://www.codementor.io/nedson/a-guide-to-handling-internet-disconnection-in-react-applications-rs7u9zpwn)
- [React Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)

## UX/UI
I created the brand Salom Mulabi, which stands for "Peace Garments." The logo incorporates "peace" in Arabic. While researching Islamic children's customs and wardrobe, I found several articles that explained teaching modesty from a young age based on the Quran. When looking at the colors, fonts, and stylings, I learned that green with gold accents represents the Islamic religion. I selected this as my color palette to continue the subliminal Islamic representation throughout the app.

> Revered is the colour green, which has been associated with Islam as a symbol of the religion itself. Green is the sacred colour of Islam, and is used for the bindings of the Qur'an (the Muslim Holy Book) and in the silken covers of the Sufi saints. It has been suggested that green is revered because it was worn by Muhammad, but it also symbolizes life and nature. When finally reaching paradise in the afterlife, the Qur'an states, "ornaments shall be given to them therein of bracelets of gold, and they shall wear green robes of fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold, (18:31)" and they will be "Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets (55:76)." In Islamic culture green and gold are the colors of paradise.

I modified a background asset to include natural, whimsical green shapes. I selected the font Comrade for its paper cut-out style that is reminiscent of children's art but still modern/hip enough for teens. For the body copy, I selected Roboto for its legibility. I kept the layout simple for a child to understand, including gold headlines and larger images.
